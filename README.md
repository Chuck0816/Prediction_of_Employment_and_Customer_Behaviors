This project explores the relationship between customer demographics, economic indicators, and employment trends. It uses data analysis and machine learning techniques to build predictive models for decision-making support, particularly for businesses and policymakers. It builds a logistic regression model that predicts the likelihood of a customer taking a loan based on demographic and economic characteristics as well as developing regression models for employment forecasting using economic indicators.
